## Sheets

Handle your presentation logic like CSS, but with Javascript.

Just the right blend of declarative (HTML selectors), imperative (Turing-complete animation logic,) and functional-reactive (just return values from functions and Sheets will handle bindings and updates.)

Supports responsive layouts out of the box with the canonical Bootstrap breakpoints: 'xs', 'sm', 'md', and 'lg'.  Don't want to use those?  Register your own breakpoints!
